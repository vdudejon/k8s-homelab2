# authentik

authentik (with a lowercase a) is a Swiss Army Knife of an authentication provider.

### Configuring Ansible AWX
Carefully follow the guide here: https://docs.goauthentik.io/integrations/services/awx-tower/
**NOTE** Make sure you set a signing certificate under "Advanced Protocol Settings."  This can be the default self-signed cert.  ChatGPT also suggests the following, which might be done automatically when you select a signing cert because I didn't explicitly set them:

    Auth providers such as AWX typically require that the SAML assertions (or responses) be signed to verify the authenticity of the data. To enable signing in Authentik:

        1. Go to your Authentik SAML provider configuration.
        2. Ensure that "Sign AuthnResponse" and "Sign Assertions" are enabled.
        3. If thereâ€™s an option for "Sign Metadata", enable it as well to ensure that the metadata provided to AWX is signed, which improves compatibility.
